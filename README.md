# faviconic

## THIS CODE IS TERRIBLE, SORRY

`faviconic` is a tool for running games inside your tab bar. Here's pong running inside 240 tabs.

The code is awful, sorry, I never really left prototype mode on this one.

To run (mac only):

* Navigate to the directory
* Run a local python http server (`python -mhttp.server`)
* Edit `baseUrL` in script.os to point at the location of `pong.html` on your machine
* Run `osascript script.os` to open a ton of chrome windows
* Play pong
